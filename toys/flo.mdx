## Overview

FLO models traffic as continuous vector fields (curb/median repulsion, goal attraction, inter-vehicle discomfort) combined with bicycle-model vehicles. Local interactions produce global structure: lanes and predictable flows without explicit lane rules.

## Key Results

- **Lane Formation Index:** 1.000 (Following) - perfect self-organization  
- **Trajectory Entropy:** 0.174 (Chaotic) - low unpredictability; structure emerges from conflict  
- **Stoppage Frequency:** 97.8% (Merging) - realistic bottleneck behavior

These metrics show: emergence works, traffic is not random, and the model reproduces realistic congestion.

## Visualization

- Real-time plots and ffmpeg-backed animations (matplotlib + FuncAnimation)
- Field visualization (quiver), vehicle trajectories, and per-frame snapshots for presentations

## Implementation Details

- Core: Python (NumPy, SciPy)
- Simulation: custom continuum field + bicycle vehicle controller
- Visualization: Matplotlib (animation to MP4)
- Experiment scripts: scenario definitions, metric logging, and plot generation

## Future Work

- Implement Fast Sweeping (O(m)) to replace FMM for linear-time field solve  
- GPU acceleration for large-scale, real-time simulations  
- Validate against real-world trajectory datasets (e.g., NGSIM)  
- Add curved roads, intersections, traffic lights, and richer driver models

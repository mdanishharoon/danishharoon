## Overview

**Deal Co-Pilot** is a modern SaaS application designed to streamline the investment due diligence process. By leveraging an **agentic AI architecture**, the platform automates the gathering and synthesis of market data, competitor landscapes, and company specifics to produce comprehensive investment committee (IC) memos.

## Technical Architecture

* **Agentic Orchestration**: Implemented a multi-agent system using **LangChain** and **OpenAI/Gemini**. The system utilizes specialized agents for market sizing, competitive moats, and financial sentiment analysis.
* **Real-time Web Intelligence**: Integrated **Tavily Search API** to provide agents with real-time browsing capabilities, ensuring all generated reports include verifiable citations and the latest market news.
* **Full-Stack Implementation**: Built with a **Next.js 15** frontend for a reactive user experience and a **FastAPI** backend to handle long-running asynchronous research tasks.

## Features

* **Natural Language Input**: Users simply provide a company name and website to trigger a deep-dive research cycle.
* **Dual-Model Support**: Support for both **OpenAI (GPT-4o)** for high-reasoning accuracy and **Gemini 1.5 Pro + Tavily** for cost-effective, high-volume research.
* **Live Progress Tracking**: A WebSocket-enabled dashboard allows users to monitor the research agents' thoughts and progress in real-time.
* **Professional IC Memos**: Generates formatted Markdown reports covering Market Dynamics, Competitive Landscapes, and Team Overviews.

## Technical Implementation

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript |
| **Backend** | FastAPI, Python 3.11 |
| **AI Orchestration** | LangChain, Agentic Workflows |
| **LLMs** | OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro |
| **Search Engine** | Tavily AI |
| **Environment** | Docker, Vercel |

## Key Outcomes

* **Reduced Research Time**: Automated the initial 4-6 hours of manual market research into a 2-minute agentic workflow.
* **Data Integrity**: Achieved 100% citation coverage for market claims by forcing agents to provide URL sources for every key metric.
* **Modular Design**: Created a flexible backend where new research agents (e.g., ESG Agent or Regulatory Agent) can be plugged into the pipeline with minimal configuration.

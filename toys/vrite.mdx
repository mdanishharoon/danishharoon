## Overview

Vrite is a modern full-stack collaborative text editor built with **Next.js**, powered by **Tiptap**, **Liveblocks**, **Convex**, and **Clerk**. Designed for real-time collaboration, authentication, and cloud persistence, Vrite enables seamless team writing and editing with live synchronization.

## Features

* **Authentication**: Secure user authentication and session management via Clerk.
* **Rich Text Editing**: Feature-rich editor experience powered by Tiptap, supporting various formatting and extensions.
* **Real-Time Collaboration**: Live cursors, multi-user editing, and presence synchronization using Liveblocks.
* **Serverless Backend**: Reactive storage and database management using Convex for low-latency data fetching.
* **Document Management**: Capabilities to create, rename, and organize multiple documents per user with instant auto-save.

## Technical Implementation

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Tiptap |
| **Auth** | Clerk |
| **Real-time** | Liveblocks |
| **Backend / DB** | Convex |
| **State Sync** | Liveblocks + Convex |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (Frontend), Convex Cloud (Backend) |

## Performance & Scalability

By leveraging a serverless architecture, Vrite handles document state transitions through **Convex** mutations, ensuring that all collaborators stay in sync without manual refreshes. The integration of **Liveblocks** provides a WebSocket-based layer for ephemeral data like cursor positions, reducing the load on the primary database while maintaining a highly responsive user interface.

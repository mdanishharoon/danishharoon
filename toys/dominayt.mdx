## Overview

Dominayt is a real-time multi-player game that blends territory control with "bullet-hell" dodging mechanics. The project serves as a practical exploration of low-level network programming, requiring high-frequency state synchronization between a server and multiple clients to ensure a fair and responsive gameplay experience.

## Gameplay Mechanics

The objective is twofold:

1. **Domination**: Players must reach and stay within the center of the game grid to accumulate points.
2. **Evasion**: A central cannon fires bullets at players; getting hit resets your progress or position, forcing a balance between aggressive point-scoring and defensive movement.

## Technical Implementation

* **Socket Programming**: Implemented a custom communication protocol using Python's `socket` library. The server acts as the "source of truth," managing player coordinates, bullet trajectories, and collision logic.
* **Concurrency**: Used multi-threading on the server side to handle multiple simultaneous client connections without blocking the main game loop.
* **State Synchronization**: Developed a serialized data exchange format to broadcast the positions of all players and projectiles across the network at 60 frames per second.
* **Client-Side Rendering**: Built the visual interface using **PyGame**, transforming raw coordinate data from the server into a smooth graphical experience.

## Project Structure

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| **`server.py`** | Coordinates game logic, handles client connections, and broadcasts state updates. |
| **`client.py`** | Renders the UI, captures user input, and communicates with the server. |
| **`my_classes.py`** | Contains OOP definitions for Players, Bullets, and Game Grids. |

## Key Challenges

One of the primary hurdles was managing **network latency**. To prevent players from "teleporting" due to lag, I implemented basic client-side interpolation and optimized the data pickles to be as lightweight as possible, ensuring that the game felt "snappy" even with multiple players on the grid.

## Overview

Built **Two-Tongue Tales**, a SaaS platform where users can generate bilingual stories with AI-created images. Developed entirely solo, handling everything from the frontend and backend to the database, AI integration, payments, and deployment. The app lets users create stories, manage a library, purchase credits, and track their content in real-time.

## Frontend & UX

Built with **Next.js 16** and **React 19**, creating a responsive interface that works across devices. Used **Radix UI** components for accessible, polished interactions and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The app includes story creation workflows, user dashboards, a story library, and checkout flows.

## Backend & Database

Used **Drizzle ORM** with **Supabase** to manage user data, stories, and credits efficiently.

## AI & Image Generation

Integrated **Google Gemini API** to generate bilingual stories based on user input. Used **Cloudinary** to handle image generation and storage for story illustrations.

## Authentication & Payments

Implemented **NextAuth** + **Resend** + **Supabase** for secure user authentication with magiclinks. Connected **Stripe** to handle credit purchases and manage the subscription/credit system with webhook validation.

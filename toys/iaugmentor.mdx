## Overview

Worked on **IAugmentor**, a Python package for intelligent data augmentation with intraclass/interclass-aware strategies: implemented **ResNet-based embedding extraction**, **K-means clustering** for intraclass diversity analysis, and **Anchored Distribution Interpolation (ADI)** to balance datasets while preserving meaningful subgroup structure.

## Technical Implementation

- **Multi-level Augmentation Pipeline**: Designed and deployed multi-level augmentation pipeline with concurrent transformation execution (threading), cluster-aware sampling for underrepresented subgroups, and comprehensive pre/post-augmentation analysis.

- **Validation & Results**: Validated IAugmentor on **Oxford-102 Flowers** and **HAM10000** skin lesion datasets, achieving targeted class balance while maintaining intraclass diversity through intelligent cluster-based sampling, documented in automated comparison reports.

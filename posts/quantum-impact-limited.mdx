- **DevOps Standardization**: Building and maintaining the company's GitHub Organization and automated **CI/CD pipelines** to eliminate deployment manual errors and accelerate delivery speed.

- **Performance Optimization**: Performing technical audits to quantify the "cost of lag," using Lighthouse metrics to demonstrate how modernizing the stack directly correlates with lower bounce rates and increased revenue.
